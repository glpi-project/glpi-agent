# This config can be used to enable a secondary proxy in the case you need it.
# A good example: you can setup another port like 443 enabling SSL support at
# the same time you have a simple http proxy on port 80.

# By default, a plugin is always disabled unless "disabled" is set to "no" or "0".
# You can uncomment the following line or set it in included configuration file
# at the end of this configuration
#disabled = no

# Set base url matching for API
#url_path = /proxy
# Note: the server URL to set on client would have to be http[s]://[host]:[port][url_path]/glpi
# By default, this should be: https://[agent-ip-or-dns]:62354/proxy/glpi

# Port on which to listen for inventory requests, default to legacy port
#port = 62354

# The delay the proxy should return as contact timeout to agents (in hours)
#prolog_freq = 24

# Option to handle proxy local storing. Set a folder full path as local_store to
# also store received XML locally. Set only_local_store to not immediatly send
# received XML to known server(s).
#only_local_store = no
#local_store = 

# To limit any abuse we expect a maximum of 30 requests by hour and by ip (3600 seconds)
# You can adjust the rate limitation by updating the requests number limit
# or the period on which apply the requests number limit
#maxrate        = 30
#maxrate_period = 3600

# The maximum number of forked handled request
#max_proxy_threads = 10

# The maximum number of proxy a request can pass-through
#max_pass_through = 5

# By default, if a GLPI server is set, we consider it supports GLPI protocol
# otherwise this proxy should only support legacy XML based protocol
#glpi_protocol = yes

# no-category config returned to agent when using CONTACT protocol without GLPI server
# or if only_local_store is set to yes
# no_category =
# Example: no_category = process,environment

# You should create and define you specific parameter in the following
# included configuration file to override any default.
# For example just set "disabled = no" in it to enable the plugin
include "proxy2-server-plugin.local"
