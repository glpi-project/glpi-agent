This is a monitoring tool for GLPI Agent on Windows. It sits on the
system tray. The icon is the GLPI Agent logo, and it changes color
from blue to red depending on the Agent status. As of now, it will
only go to red if the Agent service is not running.

By default, the tool will open minimized to the system tray, but a
window will be opened if you left-click the icon. This window shows
details such as the installed GLPI Agent version, the Agent service
status and its startup type. Also, it displays the current Agent
status (as it would be shown on the /status page).

You can force an inventory by right-clicking the system tray icon and
clicking "Force inventory" or by clicking the "Force inventory" button
on the tool window.
