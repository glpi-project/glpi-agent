# It is not recommended to modify this file in-place, because it will be
# overwritten during package upgrades.  If you want to customize, the best
# way is to use the "systemctl edit" command to create an override unit.

# For example, to pass additional options (for instance,
# --no-category=software) to the agent at startup, create an override unit
# (as is done by systemctl edit) and enter the following:

# [Service]
# Environment="OPTIONS=--no-category=software"

# But it is advised to create a dedicated ".cfg" file under /etc/glpi-agent/conf.d
# and reload the service with "systemctl reload glpi-agent.service".
# Config files under /etc/glpi-agent/conf.d won't be erased/disabled during upgrades.
