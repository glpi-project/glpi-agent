NODE is a list of node names separated by commas which should:
be the path to the XML node in inventory XML file:
FILTER can be set to select a node when the NODE match on a node list:
In that case, FILTER could be a test like KEY=VALUE where KEY is another value name of the nodes:
and VALUE the expected value and it is interpreted as a perl regex:
NODE can match on any kind of XML:
NODE path is expect to be under the first 'REQUEST' node:
As examples, 'DEVICEID' and 'CONTENT,VERSIONCLIENT' are valid paths:
