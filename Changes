Revision history for FusionInventory agent

2.6 Thu, 26 Nov 2020

core:
* as explain in Version.pm comments, actual versioning is problematic for CPAN versions,

2.5.2 Mon, 16 Dec 2019

core:
* fix HTTP server IPv6 support as HTTP::Daemon module now supports IPv6 natively
* Always compile IPv4 address as IPv6 too for trusted ips. This is needed when
  system default is to listen other IPv6 or you set httpd-ip to IPv6 address
  like '::' or '::1'.
* win32: always detach agent thread after 10 seconds when stopping the agent
  service when it is blocking on anything to guaranty the service stops in 10s max
* check agent persistent datas for a "forcerun" set flag. This is firstly intended
  to be used by win32 installer to handle the "start inventory after installation"
  option directly from the service.
  This can also be used to change or reset the agent deviceid.
* Add --set-forcerun option support to fusioninventory-agent script
* Add J-C-P contribution to simplify agent installation under linux debian/ubuntu
* fix: don't reschedule too early on a forced run at start
* fix: Don't use delaytime on config reload
* fix: use target counters reset to better support config reload

  Limit next run random delay reduction to max 1/6 of the delay if less than 6 hours,
  limit to max an hour for delay from 6 hours to 24 hours,
  and limit to max 1/24 of the delay for delay greater than a day.
  This would keep enough delay randomization to avoid mass agent server connection and
  keep next seen run more coherent with the requested delay.
* fix service shutdown when HTTP client close the connection before the agent
* fix HTTP server keep-alive support with a 8 requests by connection maximum limit
* service update to support a safe forking system to firstly support handling
  parallel http request for the Proxy HTTP server plugin.
* Proxy HTTP server plugin now support max_proxy_threads configuration which is
  set to 10 maximum concurrent requests by default.

* Fix #646: HTTP daemon not starting on CentOS 7
* revert dfcb64573e as now more generic fix has been implemented in a538abaed7
  (tested on CentOS 6)
* win32: don't show service memory usage on OS not supporting GetProcessMemoryInfo
* Fix #601: Log URL for server target and log path for local target

* win32: handle task run in a managed thread as this is more efficient than using
  perl fork with thread emulation under win32 and preserve a little memory usage.
* win32: wait service control manager is ready before really starting the service
* logger: don't use File::stat module to just get logfile file size, better use -s
  as File::stat module seems to fail in rare case.

* Reduced timeout for peer discovery and file parts downloading for P2P. This
  efficiently limits the time passed to discover the local peers and disqualify
  any busy or not responding peers in a more acceptable delay.
* For better P2P support, agent ajusts its 404 message to "Nothing found" when it
  has nothing to share with other agents. So peers won't ask again and again for
  any file part during 20 minutes by default.

2.2.0  Sat, 07 Apr 2012

Major changes:
* large speed improvement: up to 150% for a local inventory
* better multitasking support:
 - the agent use fork() to run task if needed, instead of running a new process
   from scratch, avoiding the need to use a temporary file to transmit
   parameters, with related security risks
 - the agent only forks to run a tasks when running as a server, making tracing
   and debugging easier
 - the agent only use one thread for the web interface
* better SSL support:
  - IO::Socket::SSL perl module is now required for certificate validation
  - Crypt::SSLeay perl module still allow HTTPS support, but without
    certificate validation, and the connection will be aborted unless
    certificate checking is disabled
  - validation is now performed by SSL library, and honours alternative subject
    names, and other subtilities
* large cleanup of values returned from inventory:
  - unknown values are filtered out
  - strings are trimmed for trailing spaces
  - irrelevant values, such as windows internal USB serial number, or
    controllers type and manufacturer on AIX and HPUX, are filtered out
* installation procedure automatically setup configuration and data directories
  locations in executable, there is no need to manually configure them anymore
* removal of useless features:
  - support for OCS account info have been dropped, the agent doesn't store
    arbitrary informations locally anymore
  - support for OCS network discovery and software deployment features within
    inventory task have been removed, we have better alternatives
  - useless Ping task has been dropped
* cleanup of available options:
  - deprecated --nosoft and --nosoftware options have been removed
  - --devlib, --share-dir, --basevardir and --realm options have been
    deprecated, as their values are now computed automatically at installation
  - --daemon-no-fork option has been deprecated, and replaced by --daemon
    --no-fork options
  - --info option has been deprecated, as it had no effect
  - --rpc-trust-localhost option has been deprecated, in favor of a more
    generic --http-trust option, allowing an arbitrary IP adresse or range
  - --debug option can be specified multiple times, for additional verbosity
  - --no-inventory, --no-ocsdeploy, --no-snmpquery, --no-netdiscovery options
    have been deprecated in favor of a generic --no-task option
  - --no-software, --no-printer options have been deprecated in favor of a
    generic --no-category option, and 'environment' value support has been added
* new --config option allows to select configuration backend, allowing to use
  file configuration if needed under windows, or to ignore any external
  configuration
* fusioninventory-agent-config executable has been dropped, in favor of better
  documentation
* documentation has been reviewed for consistency in various places where it
  appears (--help output, man page, configuration file)
* XML::TreePP perl module is now used instead of XML::Simple, reducing native
  perl modules dependencies
* OcsDeploy task is now deprecated. Please continue to use the 2.1.x agent is
  you need it.

Minor changes:
* Add the HARDWARE/CHASSIS_TYPE information
* Linux: report all IP addresses used by each interfaces (#854)
* HPUX: don't report unoccupied memory slots
* AIX: add LVM support
